# Automated-Dino-Game
I had automated Dino game.
It detects black colour cactus and bird and the jumps and downs.

Packages you need to install :
1)pyautogui: pip install pyautogui
2)pillow: pip install pillow

Sometimes it won't work you need to change size of i and j 
This will change size of rectange which will make it more efficient
